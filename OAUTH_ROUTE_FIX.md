# 🎉 FINAL OAuth Fix - Route Conflict Resolved!

## 🔴 Root Cause Found!

Your custom authentication routes were **BLOCKING NextAuth OAuth routes**!

### The Conflict:
```
Your custom route:  /api/auth/signin/route.ts
NextAuth needs:     /api/auth/signin/google
                    /api/auth/signin/github

Result: Custom signin folder prevented NextAuth catch-all from working!
```

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Renamed Custom Routes:
```bash
OLD PATH                      NEW PATH
/api/auth/signin       →      /api/auth/credentials-signin
/api/auth/signup       →      /api/auth/credentials-signup
```

### Updated Frontend:
- ✅ signin page calls `/api/auth/credentials-signin`
- ✅ signup page calls `/api/auth/credentials-signup`  
- ✅ OAuth buttons use `/api/auth/signin/{provider}` (NextAuth)

---

## 🚀 Test Instructions

### 1. Restart Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
